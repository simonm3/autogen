Welcome to the documentation for {project}!
===========================================

.. index.rst will be converted into index.html which is the home page for your documentation

.. The auto-generated version is in alphabetical order including:
     * an entry for each rst and ipynb file in the docs folder
     * an _rst/package entry for each package. This is where sphinx will auto-generate rst files from docstrings
   If there are no files or packages then the contents list will be examples
   Entries excluding an extension are treated as having the extension .rst

.. The contents list needs to be edited to include the chapters and packages you want in the sequence you want.
